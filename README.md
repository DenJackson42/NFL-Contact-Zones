Repository for my project "Estimating 'Contact Zones' for NFL Defenders to Improve Tackling Tracking." Final project for STAT 764 at Kansas State University.

NFL_Zones_of_Contact.pdf is the main report. All .R files I used are in the R files folder, main.R is the one that coincides with the paper and doesn't have a bunch of random code everywhere. CodeTutorial.html walks you through the main code step-by-step.

If you want to run your code you will need the data, which you can get from Kaggle:

The folder that says data has the data on my PC but not here; I didn't think the NFL would appreciate me just uploading their Next Gen Stats here. Better safe than sorry!
